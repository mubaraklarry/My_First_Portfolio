    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Mubarak Larry</strong>, a passionate software engineering student at ALX. 
        I love building clean, functional, and user-friendly web applications using modern tools.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Currently mastering <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em> to create responsive and accessible websites. 
        I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into reality through code.
    </p>
    
    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>
        I started my coding journey in 2025 and have since completed several projects, 
        including interactive web pages, dynamic forms, and responsive layouts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, contributing to open source, 
        and exploring new frameworks to expand my skill set.
    </p>
